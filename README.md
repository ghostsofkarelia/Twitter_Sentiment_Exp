## Synopsis

This application is a port of my sentiment analysis project using jQuery as a frontend framework and python based flask as a middleware framework. It's a mix of code from both projects.
Basic use of flask routing annotations. Code needs to be more sophisticated as requirements are added. Need to check whether it can provide the same functions for Session management, Authentication etc. like the Play Framework I used earlier. 

##Requirements

1.) Latest version of python

2.) Flask module installed. Use pip.

3.) [TwitterAPI](https://github.com/geduldig/TwitterAPI) installed.

Get Anaconda. It's quite useful

[Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) 

##Installation

1.) Run twitter_stream.py using the following command:
		python twitter_stream.py

2.) Go to localhost:5000

3.) Type in a search term and click GO
